In the past, leetcode allowed you to create separate sessions to track your progress.
This was helpful since you could repeatedly solve some problems over multiple
sessions and keep your working set separate. However, this feature has since
been deprecated and you have no choice but to nuke your current problem history
if you want to start "fresh".

`lcsession` is a simply CLI tool that comes with some convenient commands to
manage sessions.
